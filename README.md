# Startup-cli

Generate endless startup ideas and start working on them immediately (don't actually do this please).

### Installation

To use the command-line interface simply install the npm module globally

```bash
$ npm install -g startup-cli
```

Now, you can generate endless startup ideas with the `generate` command.
```bash
$ startup-cli generate
> Airbnb but with cars
```

### TODO
* Add startup name generator
* Add more ideas and more audiences
* Add feature to verify a startup idea already exists
* Apply to YCombinator with one of these ideas

### Contribute
Additions to the module are always welcome! 🙌
